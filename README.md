# ROKTO BORNO

The Blood Donation Application aims to facilitate blood donation activities by connecting donors with recipients in a seamless and efficient manner. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the application includes features such as user registration, blood donation requests, donor management, content management, and role-based access control.

Users can register as donors, view, and respond to donation requests, and manage their profiles. Admins have comprehensive control over user and donation management, while volunteers can create and manage donation requests. The application ensures a responsive design across all devices, integrates sweet alerts for CRUD operations, and uses environment variables to secure Firebase config keys and MongoDB credentials. Key requirements include a minimum number of notable GitHub commits, a detailed readme file, and robust role management with various user permissions. The application's dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for managing donations and content, emphasizing a smooth user experience and efficient blood donation processes.
